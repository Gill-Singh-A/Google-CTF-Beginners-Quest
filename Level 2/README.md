# Solution
We have a zip file here = 419bcccb21e0773e1a7db7ddcb4d557c7d19b5a76cd421851d9e20ab451702b252de11e90d14c3992f14bb4c5b330ea5368f8c52eb1e4c8f82f153aea6566d56. <br />
By extracting the zip file, we get a png image (logic-lock.png) in which a circuit with some logical gates are shown. <br />
We can solve this simply by looking at the output of each gates with different input. <br />
We have to provide the flag in the format : CTF{INPUTS_THAT_NEEDED_TO_BE_HIGH} <br />
So, the flag is : CTF{BCFIJ} <br />
