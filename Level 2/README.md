# Solution
We have a zip file here. <br />
By extracting the zip file, we get a png image in which a circuit with some logical gates are shown. <br />
We can solve this simply by looking at the output of each gates with different input. <br />
We have to provide the flag in the format : CTF{INPUTS_THAT_NEEDED_TO_BE_HIGH} <br />
So, the flag is : CTF{BCFIJ} <br />
