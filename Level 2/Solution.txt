We have a zip file here.
By extracting the zip file, we get a png image in which a circuit with some logical gates are shown.
We can solve this simply by looking at the output of each gates with different input.
We have to provide the flag in the format : CTF{INPUTS_THAT_NEEDED_TO_BE_HIGH}
So, the flag is : CTF{BCFIJ}
